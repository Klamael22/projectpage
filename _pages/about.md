I am an IT technician with particular interest in cybersecurity. Over the years, I have used various projects and resources to gain knowledge and hands-on experience with various concepts, tools and technologies. This site will serve as a personal portfolio of sorts, as well as a way to organize and document my projects and learning.

I plan to post everything from homelab projects to CTF write-ups and reports. Hopefully, others may find this information helpful as well.
