# Project Scope:
This project will consist of creating a virtualized homelab in Proxmox. As a jumping off point, this lab will be comprised of pfSense, Windows Server, and a few Windows 10 clients. I have already created several homelabs with Proxmox, but have not documented the process before. My primary goal is to gain hands-on experience with networking, firewalls, and Active Directory. My secondary goals are to utilize this lab to practice offensive and defensive security.

# Infrastructure:
This homelab will be constructed using what I have available:

## Dell Precision T3610: 
This computer was dropped off at a previous job to be recycled. After disposing of the drives, I put in some new HDDs, stuffed it full of RAM and took it home for homelab purposes.

### Specs:
- Xeon E5-1620 v2
- 32GB RAM
- 1TB HDD x 2
- One on-board NIC
- Intel 4-port 10Gb NIC

## Linksys MR3700 Series Smart Wi-Fi Router
Again, nothing crazy here. This is the router that was in place when I moved in.

# Hypervisor:
For every homelab project I've created so far, I've used Proxmox. It is pretty straight forward to get up and running, very flexible, and just like the rest of my lab (minus a monitor, keyboard, and cables) is free.

## Proxmox System Info:
There's plenty of resources online regarding the installation of Proxmox. The relevant specifications of my environment are as follows:
- Proxmox VE v 8.0.3
- Network: 

|Bridge|Interface|Description|
|---|---|---|
|vmbr0|enp0s25|Proxmox interface|
|vmbr1|enp3s0f3|pfSense WAN interface|
|vmbr2|N/A|pfSense LAN interface|
|vmbr3|N/A|pfSense OPT1 interface|

`vmbr0` and `vmbr1` are the only two linux bridges that are assigned a physical port for the time being.

# The VMs:
This section will serve as reference to VM creation and initial configuration.

Domain join, instead
Name: Ben Horne
Password: ********

### One More Time
I went ahead and repeated these steps to create a second client with:
- VM ID: 202
- Name: WinUser2
- Username: Harry Truman
- PC-Name: htruman-PC

# pfSense Setup via webConfigurator
Now that we have pfSense, AD, and a client, let's access pfSense webConfigurator via browser from the DC, and run through the setup wizard. 

General Information
- Hostname: pfSense
- Domain: home.arpa
- Primary DNS Server: 8.8.8.8
- Secondary DNS Server: 8.8.4.4
- Allow DNS to be overridden: disable

Set time zone.

Configure WAN Interface
- Block RFC1918 Private Networks
- Block bogon networks

When setting up pfSense, the LAN interface will automatically generate firewall rules for accessing the internet. We will need to create a similar rule for the OPT1 interface.

Navigate to Firewall > Rules > OPT1
- Create:
  - Action: Pass
  - Interface: OPT1
  - Address Family: IPv4
  - Protocol: Any
  - Source: OPT1 net
  - Destination: Any

# Active Directory: Creating Groups and Users
## Creating a Groups OU
- Open Active Directory Users and Computers
	- Right-click `someorg.local` > New > Organizatioinal Units
		- Name: Groups
	- Next I moved all users, except for `Administrator` and `Guest` from the `Users` directory to the `Groups` directory.

## Creating Users
- Under the `Users` directory.
	- Right-click > New > User:
		- Name: Ben Horne
		- User logon name: b.horne
		- Password: *******
	- Then create the second account:
		- Name: Harry Truman
		- User logon name: h.truman
		- Password: *******
	- Next let's copy the built-in `Administrator` account:
		- Name: Dale Cooper
		- User logon name: d.cooper
		- Password: ******
